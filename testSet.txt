0 By the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around .	
2 A dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires .	
2 The result might look like Vulgar .

1 Director Jay Russell stomps in hobnail boots over Natalie Babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel .	
1 This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .	
4 Muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and The Last Kiss ... provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex .

1 How can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ?	
2 Only at the prospect of Beck 's next project .	
4 A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .

1 With `` Ichi the Killer '' , Takashi Miike , Japan 's wildest filmmaker gives us a crime fighter carrying more emotional baggage than Batman ...	
2 Thin period piece .	
1 White has n't developed characters so much as caricatures , one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else .	
3 -LRB- Allen 's -RRB- best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-America diversions could ever be .	
1 It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .	
1 If you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young TV actors -LRB- Dawson Leery did what ?!? -RRB- , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie .

0 Every sequel you skip will be two hours gained .	
2 It 's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history .	
3 This slight premise ... works because of the ideal casting of the masterful British actor Ian Holm as the aged Napoleon .	
3 It 's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .

0 None of this is very original , and it is n't particularly funny .

4 -LRB- A -RRB- wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting .	
2 I highly recommend Irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him .

0 Highly uneven and inconsistent ... Margarita Happy Hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .	
2 All the filmmakers are asking of us , is to believe in something that is improbable .	
1 A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC .	
2 There 's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to .	
4 ... a delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels .	
2 Do n't hate El Crimen del Padre Amaro because it 's anti-Catholic .

2 The 1960s rebellion was misdirected : you ca n't fight your culture .	
1 Millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry .	
2 Smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong ... it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera .	
0 The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .	
2 Lohman adapts to the changes required of her , but the actress and director Peter Kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects	
0 Truly terrible .	
2 If the very concept makes you nervous ... you 'll have an idea of the film 's creepy , scary effectiveness .

3 As a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle , Sex with Strangers is a success .

1 Where the film falters is in its tone .	
3 Wow , so who knew Charles Dickens could be so light-hearted ?	
4 A live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze .	
3 The heat of the moment prevails .	
2 Wait for it to hit cable .	
1 Bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly .	
3 If you have n't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in Spielberg 's work .	
1 hard as this may be to believe , Here on Earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .	
2 The execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that Rob Schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .	
1 Fans of Plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .	
0 A crass and insulting homage to great films like Some Like It Hot and the John Wayne classics .	
2 This version moves beyond the original 's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema 's inability to stand in for true , lived experience .	
1 There 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film .	
2 Only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate .	
1 ... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .	
1 Certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either .	
3 And it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen .	
1 Grant is n't Cary and Bullock is n't Katherine .	
1 The movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .	
4 Maelstrom is strange and compelling , engrossing and different , a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor .	
1 Boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome .	
3 This is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its Freud and knows its Sade .	
4 Their work is fantastic .	
2 As a movie , it never seems fresh and vital .	
3 Intelligent , caustic take on a great writer and dubious human being .	
0 the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times	
2 There is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film Oscar : Make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture .	
1 It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .	
2 A virtual roller-coaster ride of glamour and sleaze .	
1 You might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see `` Simone , '' and consider a DVD rental instead .	
1 The movie is as padded as Allen 's jelly belly .	
3 Rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle	
4 Clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , Slap Her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up .	
3 The Scorpion King is more fun than Conan the Barbarian .	
3 A college story that works even without vulgarity , sex scenes , and cussing !	
0 A lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her .	
1 After an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .	
2 There 's something not entirely convincing about The Quiet American .	
1 Chelsea Walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe .	
2 As home movie gone haywire , it 's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , I 'd rather listen to old Tori Amos records .	
1 Ah-nuld 's action hero days might be over .	
2 In gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .	
4 -LRB- A -RRB- real pleasure in its laid-back way .	
3 there is truth here	
3 Director Chris Wedge and screenwriters Michael Berg , Michael J. Wilson and Peter Ackerman create some episodes that rival vintage Looney Tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time .	
0 Control-Alt-Delete Simone as quickly as possible	
3 It 's fun , but it 's a real howler .	
1 For all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only Caine making much of an impression .	
1 Though Frida is easier to swallow than Julie Taymor 's preposterous Titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio .	
0 Perhaps the grossest movie ever made .	
2 Spare yet audacious ...	
1 Paul Bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .	
0 There are now two signs that M. Night Shyamalan 's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : Unbreakable and Signs .	
3 The power of Shanghai Ghetto , a documentary by Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amir Mann , rests in the voices of men and women , now in their 70s , who lived there in the 1940s .	
3 Funny and touching .	
3 It 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting .	
1 The only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow .	
3 Like any good romance , Son of the Bride , proves it 's never too late to learn .	
3 The performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times .	
4 Like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely .	
4 A wild ride with eight boarders from Venice Beach that was a deserved co-winner of the Audience Award for documentaries at the Sundance Film Festival .	
2 A perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie .	
1 And Diesel is n't the actor to save it .	
0 Wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .	
2 With lesser talents , High Crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable .	
1 I could n't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy .	
3 All in all , Road to Perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence .	
0 I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere .	
4 The first Tunisian film I have ever seen , and it 's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment I 'm likely to see all year .	
1 Like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy .	
2 In my opinion , Analyze That is not as funny or entertaining as Analyze This , but it is a respectable sequel .	
4 Entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately ... dare I say , entertaining !	
3 Fear permeates the whole of Stortelling , Todd Solondz ' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique .	
2 Steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warm-blooded empathy for all his disparate Manhattan denizens -- especially the a \*\* holes .	
2 These two are generating about as much chemistry as an Iraqi factory poised to receive a UN inspector .	
2 Insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original , but it does n't disgrace it , either .	
1 No. .	
2 A tasty slice of droll whimsy .	
1 ... while the humor aspects of ` Jason X ' were far more entertaining than I had expected , everything else about the film tanks .	
1 Ritchie 's film is easier to swallow than Wertmuller 's polemical allegory , but it 's self-defeatingly decorous .	
4 Just about the surest bet for an all-around good time at the movies this summer .	
3 Yes , soar .	
0 Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other .	
0 A wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily .	
4 One of the best looking and stylish animated movies in quite a while ...	
2 Jam-packed with literally bruising jokes .	
2 -LRB- Taylor -RRB- takes us on a ride that 's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb .	
3 And he allows a gawky actor like Spall -- who could too easily become comic relief in any other film -- to reveal his impressively delicate range .	
3 The Chateau belongs to Rudd , whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting French malapropisms ... is a nonstop hoot .	
3 The Way Home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and ... often misconstrued as weakness .	
4 Jason Patric and Ray Liotta make for one splendidly cast pair .	
1 It 's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .	
2 Wait for pay per view or rental but do n't dismiss BarberShop out of hand .	
2 The film was n't preachy , but it was feminism by the book .	
4 Miller comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary .	
4 Grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to Toback 's Heidegger - and Nietzsche-referencing dialogue .	
3 Rubbo runs through a remarkable amount of material in the film 's short 90 minutes .	
0 A story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .	
3 Oddly compelling .	
3 Certainly the performances are worthwhile .	
1 Apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you 'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it .	
1 Bad company .	
4 An engrossing and infectiously enthusiastic documentary .	
0 A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .	
4 Noyce has worked wonders with the material .	
3 , is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly .	
4 As quiet , patient and tenacious as Mr. Lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline .	
1 The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots .	
2 ... a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that 's likely to irk viewers .	
1 Apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .	
2 It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors .	
2 An elegant film	
4 A zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded Elvis fans -LRB- but by no means all -RRB- will have fun with .	
3 The film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission ... if `` gory mayhem '' is your idea of a good time .	
2 That is because - damn it !	
0 It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .	
4 This is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the American underground .	
2 This follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter .	
2 Spider-Man is in the same category as X-Men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around .	
1 The movie is well done , but slow .	
0 The worst film of the year .	
0 Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .	
4 The most brilliant and brutal UK crime film since Jack Carter went back to Newcastle , the first half of Gangster No. 1 drips with style and , at times , blood .	
2 A rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by Epps .	
3 Tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme does n't drag an audience down .	
3 It 's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart .	
4 The Son Of The Bride 's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also is n't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues .	
3 At times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated -LRB- depending upon where you live -RRB- , Ignorant Fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two .	
2 Some movies blend together as they become distant memories .	
0 Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .	
3 Chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of ` ethnic cleansing . '	
1 It 's mildly amusing , but I certainly ca n't recommend it .	
0 As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .	
4 But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .	
1 Nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme .	
2 Exactly what you 'd expect from a guy named Kaos .	
2 Only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .	
1 ... the good and different idea -LRB- of middle-aged romance -RRB- is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend `` Never Again . ''	
2 A fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , Blair Witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies .	
3 As an introduction to the man 's theories and influence , Derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it 's invaluable .	
0 The actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .	
3 Goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing ... but she and writing partner Laurence Coriat do n't manage an equally assured narrative coinage .	
3 Becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the Papin sisters .	
1 Though Harris is affecting at times , he can not overcome the sense that Pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities .	
3 Those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up .	
0 A long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral .	
2 is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation .	
2 Not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens .	
2 would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera .	
4 Intriguing and stylish .	
2 You get the idea , though , that Kapur intended the film to be more than that .	
3 A tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more .	
0 Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .	
2 `` I blame all men for war , '' -LRB- the warden 's daughter -RRB- tells her father .	
2 If you do n't laugh , flee .	
0 The appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .	
1 About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .	
1 Its one-sidedness ... flirts with propaganda .	
1 No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a Michael Jackson sort of way .	
1 Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs , seems inconceivable .	
1 Brosnan 's finest non-Bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .	
1 It leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .	
1 Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material .	
3 A witty , whimsical feature debut .	
1 Throw Smoochy from the train !	
2 It was a dark and stormy night ...	
3 A full experience , a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence .	
1 For all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears , starring Ben Affleck , seem downright Hitchcockian .	
3 ... there 's enough cool fun here to warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages .	
4 It is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter .	
3 As Antonia is assimilated into this newfangled community , the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion .	
3 And it is .	
1 The film did n't convince me that Calvin Jr. 's Barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of Chicago 's South Side .	
0 ... about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season .	
3 Both Grant and Hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others .	
1 Busy urban comedy is clearly not Zhang 's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy .	
2 Ruh-roh !	
4 It 's a lovely , sad dance highlighted by Kwan 's unique directing style .	
0 is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his Halloween trip to the Haunted House .	
2 The pace of the film is very slow -LRB- for obvious reasons -RRB- and that too becomes off-putting .	
3 Twohy 's a good yarn-spinner , and ultimately the story compels .	
3 What 's not to like about a movie with a ` children 's ' song that includes the line ` My stepdad 's not mean , he 's just adjusting ' ?	
0 A loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the TV series .	
3 A lot smarter than your average Bond .	
2 Director David Jacobson gives Dahmer a consideration that the murderer never game his victims .	
3 Those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to Ichi .	
2 -LRB- It -RRB- highlights not so much the crime lord 's messianic bent , but Spacey 's .	
2 Mild , meandering teen flick .	
2 Exposing the ways we fool ourselves is One Hour Photo 's real strength .	
1 He seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither .	
0 Not even Felinni would know what to make of this Italian freakshow .	
2 About Amy 's cuteness , Amy 's career success -LRB- she 's a best-selling writer of self-help books who ca n't help herself -RRB- , and Amy 's neuroses when it comes to men .	
4 Cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh .	
3 Stuffed to the brim with ideas , American instigator Michael Moore 's film is a rambling examination of American gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition .	
2 It bites hard .	
3 Cut through the layers of soap-opera emotion and you find a scathing portrayal of a powerful entity strangling the life out of the people who want to believe in it the most .	
2 It understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking .	
1 Spider-Man is about growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body , and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units .	
4 is one of this year 's very best pictures .	
3 Mostly , -LRB- Goldbacher -RRB- just lets her complicated characters be unruly , confusing and , through it all , human .	
1 Too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .	
1 The fact that the ` best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of Demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it .	
2 The tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons .	
0 It 's a visual Rorschach test and I must have failed .	
1 Sodden and glum , even in those moments where it 's supposed to feel funny and light .	
4 Good performances and a realistic , non-exploitive approach make Paid in Full worth seeing .	
4 Beautifully produced .	
3 It 's rare to find a film to which the adjective ` gentle ' applies , but the word perfectly describes Pauline & Paulette .	
1 A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken .	
1 The script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material .	
3 -LRB- City -RRB- reminds us how realistically nuanced a Robert De Niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of ` Analyze This ' -LRB- 1999 -RRB- and ` Analyze That , ' promised -LRB- or threatened -RRB- for later this year .	
1 The filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they wo n't much care about .	
1 ... a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes .	
3 Criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes My Big Fat Greek Wedding look like an apartheid drama .	
0 Does n't deserve a passing grade -LRB- even on a curve -RRB- .	
1 It 's just a movie that happens to have Jackie Chan in it .	
1 Naipaul fans may be disappointed .	
4 A beautiful , entertaining two hours .	
3 Writer\/director Walter Hill is in his hypermasculine element here , once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable .	
3 Naomi Watts is terrific as Rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation .	
3 A giddy and provocative sexual romp that has something to say .	
2 As Allen 's execution date closes in , the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator David Presson .	
1 Like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six .	
2 The movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like Chris Rock .	
4 Speaks eloquently about the symbiotic relationship between art and life .	
2 Like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless .	
1 Um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ?	
2 Rabbit-Proof Fence will probably make you angry .	
1 Time stands still in more ways that one in Clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable .	
1 To honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to American workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed .	
0 It just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on -LRB- or be entertained by -RRB- .	
4 likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes .	
1 What with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .	
1 Breen 's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting .	
4 You can take the grandkids or the grandparents and never worry about anyone being bored ... audience is a sea of constant smiles and frequent laughter .	
1 Try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes Edward Burns ' Sidewalks of New York look like Oscar Wilde .	
1 In its chicken heart , Crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises .	
1 Almost peerlessly unsettling .	
4 Stanley Kwan has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made , but one of the best love stories of any stripe .	
0 It 's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .	
3 Now here 's a sadistic bike flick that would have made Vittorio De Sica proud .	
3 Meticulously uncovers a trail of outrageous force and craven concealment .	
2 Occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring .	
0 Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?	
2 At no point during K-19 : The Widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot .	
4 Jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness .	
4 A generous , inspiring film that unfolds with grace and humor and gradually becomes a testament to faith .	
4 Mr. Deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy .	
3 Pretty good little movie .	
1 The story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than I 'd care to count .	
4 Methodical , measured , and gently tedious in its comedy , Secret Ballot is a purposefully reductive movie -- which may be why it 's so successful at lodging itself in the brain .	
3 imagine a scenario where Bergman approaches Swedish fatalism using Gary Larson 's Far Side humor	
0 This is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life .	
3 Even at its worst , it 's not half-bad .	
3 Its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director 's previous popcorn work .	
0 You may be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .	
1 But Windtalkers does n't beat that one , either .	
0 I 'd rather watch a rerun of The Powerpuff Girls	
0 All of the filmmakers ' calculations ca n't rescue Brown Sugar from the curse of blandness .	
0 There 's only one way to kill Michael Myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies .	
0 Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell .	
3 An intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind of quality .	
0 ... what a banal bore the preachy Circuit turns out to be	
1 The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game .	
3 Koury frighteningly and honestly exposes one teenager 's uncomfortable class resentment and , in turn , his self-inflicted retaliation .	
2 `` Me Without You '' is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades .	
2 The first half bursts with a goofy energy previous Disney films only used for a few minutes here and there .	
3 Coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else .	
3 Combines a comically dismal social realism with a farcically bawdy fantasy of redemption and regeneration .	
0 Director Douglas McGrath takes on Nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading .	
2 A sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale .	
4 Jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama .	
1 ... del Toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy .	
4 Peter Jackson and company once again dazzle and delight us , fulfilling practically every expectation either a longtime Tolkien fan or a movie-going neophyte could want .	
2 A glorious mess .	
3 ... standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added .	
1 Showtime is n't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again .	
1 This is a third-person story now , told by Hollywood , and much more ordinary for it .	
2 Does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer boring .	
4 It 's a masterpeice .	
3 A chilling tale of one of the great crimes of 20th Century France : the murder of two rich women by their servants in 1933 .	
1 The director mostly plays it straight , turning Leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .	
0 This strenuously unfunny Showtime deserves the hook .	
4 A no-holds-barred cinematic treat .	
1 The Quiet American is n't a bad film , it 's just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar .	
3 A sensitive and astute first feature by Anne-Sophie Birot .	
3 What redeems the film is the cast , particularly the Ya-Yas themselves .	
2 The most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 Miles to Graceland .	
1 Unfortunately , that 's precisely what Arthur Dong 's Family Fundamentals does .	
1 While Hollywood Ending has its share of belly laughs -LRB- including a knockout of a closing line -RRB- , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity .	
0 Our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender -- and I know this because I 've seen ` jackass : the movie . '	
0 Frankly , it 's kind of insulting , both to men and women .	
0 One of the worst movies of the year .	
3 It 's a quirky , off-beat project .	
1 Stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about .	
1 Choppy , overlong documentary about ` The Lifestyle . '	
1 Watching Queen of the Damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in .	
3 A complex psychological drama about a father who returns to his son 's home after decades away .	
2 If you 're paying attention , the `` big twists '' are pretty easy to guess - but that does n't make the movie any less entertaining .	
3 Earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding .	
4 Fairy-tale formula , serves as a paper skeleton for some very good acting , dialogue , comedy , direction and especially charm .	
1 From its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , Bartleby squanders as much as it gives out .	
2 Ultimately , Jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with .	
3 It 's an ambitious film , and as with all ambitious films , it has some problems .	
3 The real triumphs in Igby come from Philippe , who makes Oliver far more interesting than the character 's lines would suggest , and Sarandon , who could n't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable WASP matron .	
4 Morton deserves an Oscar nomination .	
3 For those of an indulgent , slightly sunbaked and summery mind , Sex and Lucia may well prove diverting enough .	
1 Represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen .	
3 Its almost too-spectacular coastal setting distracts slightly from an eccentric and good-naturedly aimless story .	
0 But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .	
1 Scotland , PA is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept .	
1 Often silly -- and gross -- but it 's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films .	
4 An action\/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of Day of the Jackal , The French Connection , and Heat .	
2 It 's time to let your hair down -- Greek style .	
3 The re-release of Ron Howard 's Apollo 13 in the IMAX format proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages .	
2 Leading a double life in an American film only comes to no good , but not here .	
4 Fontaine 's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal .

4 Without resorting to camp or parody , Haynes -LRB- like Sirk , but differently -RRB- has transformed the rhetoric of Hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange .	
2 I prefer Soderbergh 's concentration on his two lovers over Tarkovsky 's mostly male , mostly patriarchal debating societies .	
2 The setting is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of `` Intacto 's '' dangerous and seductively stylish game .

3 A headline-fresh thriller set among orthodox Jews on the West Bank , Joseph Cedar 's Time Of Favor manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation , it does so without compromising that complexity .

2 A picture as erratic as its central character .	
3 Its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing .

1 I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it .

3 The Rock is destined to be the 21st Century 's new `` Conan '' and that he 's going to make a splash even greater than Arnold Schwarzenegger , Jean-Claud Van Damme or Steven Segal .

2 If you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again .	
2 By the end , you just do n't care whether that cold-hearted snake Petrovich -LRB- that would be Reno -RRB- gets his comeuppance .	
1 It 's easy to love Robin Tunney -- she 's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices .	
0 Talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture .	
3 What enlivens this film , beyond the astute direction of Cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors , is a note of defiance over social dictates .	
1 Meandering and confusing .	
1 But the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed .	
1 Suspend your disbelief here and now , or you 'll be shaking your head all the way to the credits .	
1 A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis .	
3 A fun ride .	
0 To paraphrase a line from another Dickens ' novel , Nicholas Nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato .	
2 Like its predecessor , it 's no classic , but it provides a reasonably attractive holiday contraption , one that families looking for a clean , kid-friendly outing should investigate .	
0 To the civilized mind , a movie like Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement .	
2 I ca n't .	
3 A sweet-tempered comedy that forgoes the knee-jerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies .	
3 So genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen .	
0 The following things are not at all entertaining : The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching Seinfeld -LRB- who is also one of the film 's producers -RRB- do everything he can to look like a good guy .	
3 Chaiken ably balances real-time rhythms with propulsive incident .	
2 An exhilarating serving of movie fluff .	
3 Antwone Fisher certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories but , with few exceptions , it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it .	
3 The script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors .	
3 Lathan and Diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest .	
2 -LRB- It -RRB- has the feel of a summer popcorn movie .	
0 If this is cinema , I pledge allegiance to Cagney and Lacey .	
4 Colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical ... the rare sequel that 's better than its predecessor .	
2 This version of H.G. Wells ' Time Machine was directed by H.G. Wells ' great-grandson .	
0 An amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video .	
1 It 's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after .	
1 After all , it 'll probably be in video stores by Christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies .	
4 A hugely rewarding experience that 's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as Grant 's two best films -- Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones 's Diary .	
2 With Rare Birds , as with The Shipping News before it , an attempt is made to transplant a Hollywood star into Newfoundland 's wild soil -- and The Rock once again resists the intrusion .	
1 If swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .	
2 Like an episode of MTV 's Undressed , with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance ... indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper .	
3 A solidly entertaining little film .	
3 Highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it 's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring Ice-T in a major role .	
4 Much of All About Lily Chou-Chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep .	
3 It 's full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns De Palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s .	
3 An often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century .	
4 Every moment crackles with tension , and by the end of the flick , you 're on the edge of your seat .	
3 K-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories , but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of Man confronting the Demons of his own fear and paranoia .	
4 Like blended shades of lipstick , these components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs .	
1 What 's worse is that Pelosi knows it .	
1 The Mothman Prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece .	
3 By the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .	
1 Here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit Sascha .	
3 All in all , an interesting look at the life of the campaign-trail press , especially ones that do n't really care for the candidate they 're forced to follow .	
2 Your taste for Jonah - A Veggie Tales Movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the Holy Spirit .	
2 Especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie .	
3 More of the same from Taiwanese auteur Tsai Ming-liang , which is good news to anyone who 's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director 's previous films .	
1 But mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted .	
3 Succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides .	
2 While Glover , the irrepressible eccentric of River 's Edge , Dead Man and Back to the Future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents Bartleby 's main overall flaw .	
0 Long before it 's over , you 'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser .	
3 According to the script , Grant and Bullock 's characters are made for each other .	
2 The real question this movie poses is not ` Who ? '	
1 Not a strike against Yang 's similarly themed Yi Yi , but I found What Time ?	
1 Even Murphy 's expert comic timing and famed charisma ca n't rescue this effort .	
2 Yo , it 's The Days Of Our Lives meets Electric Boogaloo .	
3 That old adage about women being unknowable gets an exhilarating new interpretation in Morvern Callar .	
1 It 's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 .	
3 As dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost Shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .	
0 One of those strained caper movies that 's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends .	
1 A few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and Jordan Brady 's direction is prosaic .	
0 To call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .	
2 If there 's one big point to Promises , it 's that nothing can change while physical and psychological barriers keep the sides from speaking even one word to each other .	
1 I felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes .	
2 Merchant has n't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage .	
3 The series ' message about making the right choice in the face of tempting alternatives remains prominent , as do the girls ' amusing personalities .	
3 A touching , sophisticated film that almost seems like a documentary in the way it captures an Italian immigrant family on the brink of major changes .	
2 Ali 's graduation from little screen to big is far less painful than his opening scene encounter with an over-amorous terrier .	
2 Walsh ca n't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in Janice 's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm .	
4 A lively and engaging examination of how similar obsessions can dominate a family .	
4 Both heartbreaking and heartwarming ... just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it 's tremendously moving .	
2 Nor is it a romantic comedy .	
1 A mess .	
2 Gone are the flamboyant mannerisms that are the trademark of several of his performances .	
4 With an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , Everett remains a perfect Wildean actor , and a relaxed Firth displays impeccable comic skill .	
1 Too bad Maggio could n't come up with a better script .	
1 A movie that harps on media-constructed ` issues ' like whether compromise is the death of self ... this Orgasm -LRB- wo n't be an -RRB- exceedingly memorable one for most people .	
4 Both a successful adaptation and an enjoyable film in its own right .	
1 This odd , distant Portuguese import more or less borrows from Bad Lieutenant and Les Vampires , and comes up with a kind of art-house gay porn film .	
4 While centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the Yiddish theater , both in America and Israel .	
1 It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie .	
1 We 're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments .	
2 Even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it does n't make for completely empty entertainment	
3 A certain sexiness underlines even the dullest tangents .	
4 One of those rare films that seems as though it was written for no one , but somehow manages to convince almost everyone that it was put on the screen , just for them .	
1 There are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations .	
2 But be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still .	
3 Boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun .	
3 But it does have one saving grace .	
1 ` Unfaithful ' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory .	
2 Works because we 're never sure if Ohlinger 's on the level or merely a dying , delusional man trying to get into the history books before he croaks .	
1 Bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as Spider-Man does to the experiences of most teenagers .	
4 -LRB- Taymor -RRB- utilizes the idea of making Kahlo 's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work .	
1 What little grace -LRB- Rifkin 's -RRB- tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics .	
1 The locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand .	
3 The movie 's seams may show ... but Pellington gives `` Mothman '' an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling .	
1 Stale first act , Scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes .	
3 ` Possession , ' based on the book by A.S. Byatt , demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit	
1 A rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel .	
3 Director Alfonso Cuaron gets vivid , convincing performances from a fine cast , and generally keeps things going at a rapid pace , occasionally using an omniscient voice-over narrator in the manner of French New Wave films .	
3 waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot Oscar season currently underway .	
1 Watching this film , what we feel is n't mainly suspense or excitement .	
0 A mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read The Catcher in the Rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia	
3 Featherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .	
3 Able to provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history .	
1 It is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see .	
2 Believes so fervently in humanity that it feels almost anachronistic , and it is too cute by half .	
3 With We Were Soldiers , Hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the Vietnam War before the pathology set in .	
0 Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .	
4 An escapist confection that 's pure entertainment .	
2 I 'll put it this way : If you 're in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish , this is the movie for you .	
3 The structure is simple , but in its own way , Rabbit-Proof Fence is a quest story as grand as The Lord of the Rings .	
1 If Oscar had a category called Best Bad Film You Thought Was Going To Be Really Awful But Was n't , Guys would probably be duking it out with The Queen of the Damned for the honor .	
3 Takashi Miike keeps pushing the envelope : Ichi the Killer	
2 ` Enigma ' is the kind of engaging historical drama that Hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of ` We Were Soldiers . '	
4 An impressive hybrid .	
2 Cockettes has the glorious , gaudy benefit of much stock footage of Those Days , featuring all manner of drag queen , bearded lady and lactating hippie .	
0 It 's horribly depressing and not very well done .	
4 One of the best rock documentaries ever .	
1 Reggio and Glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that Glass 's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .	
1 Simplistic , silly and tedious .	
1 The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th Heaven . ''	
1 The story itself is actually quite vapid .	
2 This new Time Machine is hardly perfect ... yet it proves surprisingly serviceable .	
2 If horses could fly , this is surely what they 'd look like .	
3 A huge box-office hit in Korea , Shiri is a must for genre fans .	
2 It 's clear that Mehta simply wanted to update her beloved genre for the thousands of Indians who fancy themselves too sophisticated for the cheese-laced spectacles that pack 'em in on the subcontinent .	
3 A wonderful , ghastly film .	
1 Bad Company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are n't looking for them .	
1 The film does n't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes Wilco a big deal .	
1 Over and over again .	
1 But there 's plenty to offend everyone ...	
1 While Scorsese 's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that `` Gangs '' is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that 's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about .	
3 Spielberg 's picture is smarter and subtler than -LRB- Total Recall and Blade Runner -RRB- , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences .	
1 An instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product .	
2 cynical and serious look at teenage boys doing what they do best - being teenagers .	
1 This is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm .	
0 Madonna has made herself over so often now , there 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like Michael Jackson 's nose .	
3 There is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work , but it is nevertheless compelling .	
0 Those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .	
0 is that it 's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime .	
4 Insanely hilarious !	
1 A waterlogged version of ` Fatal Attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set ... a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads .	
1 Insufferably naive .	
1 Animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots .	
2 it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like My Big Fat Greek Wedding	
1 A straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality .	
2 Films are made of little moments .	
3 Catch it ... if you can !	
1 The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .	
3 To others , it will remind them that Hong Kong action cinema is still alive and kicking .	
3 Even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern .	
4 Secret Ballot is a funny , puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving .	
1 As for children , they wo n't enjoy the movie at all .	
4 It 's no lie -- Big Fat Liar is a real charmer .	
4 A witty , low-key romantic comedy .	
3 It 's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits .	
2 Bartlett 's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man 's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made .	
0 The movie is a dud .	
4 It 's a fun adventure movie for kids -LRB- of all ages -RRB- that like adventure .	
1 It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .	
1 This picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .	
1 There are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending .	
1 True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .	
3 There are so few films about the plight of American Indians in modern America that Skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front .	
1 It 's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure .	
0 What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .	
0 One sloughs one 's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .	
3 A sense of real magic , perhaps .	
3 A weird little movie that 's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern L.A. 's show-biz and media subcultures .	
1 A little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .	
3 This version does justice both to Stevenson and to the sci-fi genre .	
0 Hate it because it 's lousy .	
4 ... a series of tales told with the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing .	
1 Its plot and animation offer daytime TV serviceability , but little more .	
1 Video games are more involving than this mess .	
1 None of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .	
2 It did n't go straight to video .	
3 Poignant Japanese epic about adolescent anomie and heartbreak .	
3 Uneven , self-conscious but often hilarious spoof .	
4 Many a parent and their teen -LRB- or preteen -RRB- kid could bond while watching A Walk To Remember .	
4 It 's no surprise that as a director Washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer Derek Luke .	
2 A collage	
3 All three women deliver remarkable performances .	
2 Meant to reduce Blake 's philosophy into a tragic coming-of-age saga punctuated by bursts of animator Todd McFarlane 's superhero dystopia .	
1 But it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it 's won .	
3 What 's really so appealing about the characters is their resemblance to everyday children .	
3 If you 're down for a silly hack-and-slash flick , you can do no wrong with Jason X.	
2 You Should Pay Nine Bucks for This : Because you can hear about suffering Afghan refugees on the news and still be unaffected .	
1 Wildly incompetent but brilliantly named Half Past Dead -- or for Seagal pessimists : Totally Past His Prime .	
1 Most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .	
3 While it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting , brisk delight .	
0 There 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer .	
2 Maid in Manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road ... But as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans ' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection .	
0 It all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .	
3 Strip it of all its excess debris , and you 'd have a 90-minute , four-star movie .	
0 The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .	
2 Not one moment in the enterprise did n't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow .	
2 `` It 's all about the image . ''	
0 The issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year 's -LRB- unintentionally -RRB- funniest moments , that it 's impossible to care .	
3 If you 're in the right B-movie frame of mind , it may just scare the pants off you .	
0 Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .	
4 may prove to be -LRB- Tsai 's -RRB- masterpiece .	
1 Donovan ... squanders his main asset , Jackie Chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences .	
2 There are problems with this film that even 3 Oscar winners ca n't overcome , but it 's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling .	
3 Interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story .	
1 Predictably melodramatic .	
3 Tends to pile too many `` serious issues '' on its plate at times , yet remains fairly light , always entertaining , and smartly written .	
1 The connected stories of Breitbart and Hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in Invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .	
2 It 's not particularly subtle ... However , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion .	
3 A terrific insider look at the star-making machinery of tinseltown .	
3 The complex , politically charged tapestry of contemporary Chinese life this exciting new filmmaker has brought to the screen is like nothing we Westerners have seen before .	
1 Has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be .	
2 Yet another movie which presumes that high school social groups are at war , let alone conscious of each other 's existence .	
1 In the not-too-distant future , movies like Ghost Ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds .	
3 If the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals , it nonetheless sustains interest during the long build-up of expository material .	
1 ... a confusing drudgery .	
3 It is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients .	
4 The problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart .	
4 Nair 's cast is so large it 's Altman-esque , but she deftly spins the multiple stories in a vibrant and intoxicating fashion .	
4 The artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from Japan , the characters move with grace and panache .	
4 A film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours .	
3 Too damn weird to pass up , and for the blacklight crowd , way cheaper -LRB- and better -RRB- than Pink Floyd tickets .	
4 Sweetly sexy , funny and touching .	
1 -LRB- T -RRB- he film is never sure to make a clear point -- even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation .	
1 The cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate .	
1 Seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it 's a sad , sick sight .	
3 Though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation .	
1 ` Opening up ' the play more has partly closed it down .	
1 He fails .	
1 can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of Jesse Helms ' anti- Castro rhetoric , which are included	
1 Debut effort by `` Project Greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish .	
1 Sadly , Full Frontal plays like the work of a dilettante .	
4 Mazel tov to a film about a family 's joyous life acting on the Yiddish stage .	
2 A fascinating but choppy documentary .	
2 just pile up .	
2 The camera whirls !	
3 What makes the movie special is its utter sincerity .	
4 -LRB- A -RRB- devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid Holocaust drama .	
4 It is definitely worth seeing .	
3 Director Roger Kumble offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity .	
1 A worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school TV special .	
1 The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .	
2 It 's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you 'll likely think of this one .	
1 ... familiar and predictable , and 4\/5ths of it might as well have come from a Xerox machine rather than -LRB- writer-director -RRB- Franc .	
3 If you come from a family that eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights together , then go see this delightful comedy .	
3 At its most basic , this cartoon adventure is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating .	
3 Simone is not a bad film .	
1 There may have been a good film in `` Trouble Every Day , '' but it is not what is on the screen .	
2 And that should tell you everything you need to know about All the Queen 's Men .	
3 It 's always fascinating to watch Marker the essayist at work .	
3 Your children will be occupied for 72 minutes .	
2 It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely .	
4 A slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time .	
0 Vulgar is too optimistic a title .	
3 Campanella 's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over Rafael 's evolution .	
1 What 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .	
3 Left me with the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of Charlotte 's web of desire and desperation .	
0 The actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .	
4 Adaptation is simply brilliant .	
3 I enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .	
1 Eight Legged Freaks falls flat as a spoof .	
3 Splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity .	
1 It 's not a great monster movie .	
2 A drama of great power , yet some members of the audience will leave the theater believing they have seen a comedy .	
3 American musical comedy as we know it would n't exist without the precedent of Yiddish theater , whose jolly , fun-for-fun 's - sake communal spirit goes to the essence of Broadway .	
1 Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness .	
3 The difference between Cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited .	
0 Very stupid and annoying .	
0 Crummy .	
3 Cold , nervy and memorable .	
2 ` Tobey Maguire is a poster boy for the geek generation . '	
1 Tedious Norwegian offering which somehow snagged an Oscar nomination .	
4 The enjoyable Undercover Brother , a zany mix of Saturday Night Live-style parody , '70s Blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild , dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy .	
1 Frankly , it 's pretty stupid .	
2 The climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does	
4 It 's a cool event for the whole family .	
3 And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .	
2 You could love Safe Conduct -LRB- Laissez Passer -RRB- for being a subtitled French movie that is 170 minutes long .	
1 Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .	
3 An average kid-empowerment fantasy with slightly above-average brains .	
1 A sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis .	
1 With flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , Undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins .	
0 Two hours of junk .	
2 A perfectly respectable , perfectly inoffensive , easily forgettable film .	
2 So here it is : It 's about a family of sour immortals .	
3 By halfway through this picture I was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it ... Then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .	
3 ... a funny yet dark and seedy clash of cultures and generations .	
4 Everyone 's insecure in Lovely and Amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships .	
0 It is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year .	
3 A pleasing , often-funny comedy .	
0 The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .	
4 borrows a bit from the classics `` Wait Until Dark '' and `` Extremities '' ... But in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself .	
3 It may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul 's - eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case .	
3 Walter Hill 's Undisputed is like a 1940s Warner Bros. .	
1 Its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like Prophet Jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .	
3 Adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of Orlean 's themes without being a true adaptation of her book .	
2 There 's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of Queen of the Damned , as its origins in an Anne Rice novel dictate , but generally , it 's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .	
3 A meatier deeper beginning and\/or ending would have easily tipped this film into the `` A '' range , as is , it 's a very very strong `` B + . ''	
1 Little more than a well-mounted history lesson .	
4 Leave it to the French to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama .	
0 Will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 .	
3 Drumline ably captures the complicated relationships in a marching band .	
3 Confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from King Hunk .	
1 -LRB- The film 's -RRB- taste for `` shock humor '' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of Tom Green and the Farrelly Brothers .	
1 The film is flat .	
2 Feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum .	
2 A witty , trenchant , wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking .	
0 A horrible , 99-minute stink bomb .	
3 There 's nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like The Bourne Identity that 's packed with just as much intelligence as action .	
3 Like Mike is n't going to make box office money that makes Michael Jordan jealous , but it has some cute moments , funny scenes , and hits the target audience -LRB- young Bow Wow fans -RRB- - with nothing but net .	
1 I 've had more interesting -- and , dare I say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama .	
1 ... less a story than an inexplicable nightmare , right down to the population 's shrugging acceptance to each new horror .	
0 A devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism .	
4 An engrossing and grim portrait of hookers : what they think of themselves and their clients .	
1 Makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place .	
2 Some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills .	
3 It 's not too fast and not too slow .	
1 Starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker Yvan Attal quickly writes himself into a corner .	
1 The inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror\/action hybrid .	
2 ... tackling a low-budget movie in which inexperienced children play the two main characters might not be the best way to cut your teeth in the film industry .	
1 Unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various New York City locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style .	
3 Jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters , especially if you 're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging .	
1 Unfortunately , we 'd prefer a simple misfire .	
2 Deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits .	
2 It 's Young Guns meets Goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs .	
1 An artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike .	
1 It 's got the brawn , but not the brains .	
0 The slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .	
4 Miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it 's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images .	
1 In truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick -LRB- but none of the sheer lust -RRB- .	
1 Perhaps even the SLC high command found writer-director Mitch Davis 's wall of kitsch hard going .	
3 As a kind of colorful , dramatized PBS program , Frida gets the job done .	
0 With the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which They is n't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .	
2 Dogtown and Z-Boys more than exposes the roots of the skateboarding boom that would become `` the punk kids ' revolution . ''	
4 That Haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace .	
2 This is a nervy , risky film , and Villeneuve has inspired Croze to give herself over completely to the tormented persona of Bibi .	
1 Overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste .	
2 But Death to Smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end .	
3 A keep - 'em - guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters .	
1 When -LRB- Reno -RRB- lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at George W. Bush , Henry Kissinger , Larry King , et al. , Reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture .	
0 -LRB- A -RRB- poorly executed comedy .	
1 It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s .	
1 The film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film .	
4 The performances are immaculate , with Roussillon providing comic relief .	
3 Henry Bean 's thoughtful screenplay provides no easy answers , but offers a compelling investigation of faith versus intellect	
1 What begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes .	
3 ... a guiltless film for nice evening out .	
4 Shanghai Ghetto may not be as dramatic as Roman Polanski 's The Pianist , but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high .	
2 `` The Tuxedo '' should have been the vehicle for Chan that `` The Mask '' was for Jim Carrey .	
0 Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .	
2 An original little film about one young woman 's education .	
2 It 's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn .	
2 The threat	
3 Secretary is just too original to be ignored .	
0 It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceless and ugly .	
1 Anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly .	
2 Underachieves only in not taking the Shakespeare parallels quite far enough .	
1 The explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .	
2 Like the series , the movie is funny , smart , visually inventive , and most of all , alive .	
0 Philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .	
2 The performances are all solid ; it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie .	
1 The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .	
4 A terrifically entertaining specimen of Spielbergian sci-fi .	
4 An animation landmark as monumental as Disney 's 1937 breakthrough Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs .	
1 ... the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy .	
3 It 's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look .	
3 K-19 : The Widowmaker is derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining .	
1 An unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas .	
2 ` The film is stark , straightforward and deadly ... an unnatural calm that 's occasionally shaken by ... blasts of rage , and later , violent jealousy . '	
1 Elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level .	
2 Handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism .	
3 The storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of Gosford Park have come to assume is just another day of Brit cinema .	
2 At its best -LRB- and it does have some very funny sequences -RRB- Looking for Leonard reminds you just how comically subversive silence can be .	
2 A brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on Hollywood , success , artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy .	
4 One of the most exciting action films to come out of China in recent years .	
0 A real snooze .	
1 El Crimen Del Padre Amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-Catholic protestors .	
4 A fanciful drama about Napoleon 's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility .	
1 The film 's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down .	
3 At its best , which occurs often , Michael Moore 's Bowling for Columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the ` Are we a sick society ? '	
3 -LRB- Caine -RRB- proves once again he has n't lost his touch , bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film .	
1 Too often , Son of the Bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained `` big moment '' will occur and not `` if . ''	
1 It 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .	
2 I admit it , I hate to like it .	
1 Deuces Wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like The Wanderers and A Bronx Tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .	
2 Chomp chomp !	
3 It has plenty of laughs .	
1 Narc is all menace and atmosphere .	
3 The Saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence , and The Quiet American brings us right into the center of that world .	
2 Jarecki and Gibney do find enough material to bring Kissinger 's record into question and explain how the diplomat 's tweaked version of statecraft may have cost thousands and possibly millions of lives .	
0 Another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures .	
1 The redeeming feature of Chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in The Tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine .	
0 A gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups .	
2 Nair does n't use -LRB- Monsoon Wedding -RRB- to lament the loss of culture .	
1 But even then , I 'd recommend waiting for DVD and just skipping straight to her scenes .	
3 This is the kind of subject matter that could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker , but Ayres makes the right choices at every turn .	
1 ... most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` Queen '' and less of the `` Damned . ''	
3 The story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy .	
0 What an embarrassment .	
4 Sensitive ensemble performances and good period reconstruction add up to a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments .	
2 Does anyone much think the central story of Brendan Behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ?	
2 It 's 51 times better than this .	
1 In the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we 're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses .	
3 A solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony .	
1 Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions .	
3 A confluence of kiddie entertainment , sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design .	
1 Jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from Nijinsky 's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive .	
3 Murderous Maids has a lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by Testud ... and Parmentier .	
1 Well made but uninvolving , Bloodwork is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .	
0 Franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , but he does not give the transcendent performance SONNY needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic .	
2 It just does n't have much else ... especially in a moral sense .	
3 Has enough wit , energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they 're not interested .	
4 A terrific B movie -- in fact , the best in recent memory .	
2 It tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did .	
3 Well , it probably wo n't have you swinging from the trees hooting it 's praises , but it 's definitely worth taking a look .	
2 The most remarkable -LRB- and frustrating -RRB- thing about World Traveler , which opens today in Manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank .	
1 Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare I say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .	
3 an original and highly cerebral examination of the psychopathic mind	
1 There is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us .	
2 So earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script .	
3 An unflinching , complex portrait of a modern Israel that is rarely seen on-screen .	
1 Though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful .	
4 Raimi and his team could n't have done any better in bringing the story of Spider-Man to the big screen .	
3 The Woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made Allen 's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring .	
0 Spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations	
0 ` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .	
1 It has no affect on the Kurds , but it wore me down .	
0 Thumbs down .	
4 Puts to rest any thought that the German film industry can not make a delightful comedy centering on food .	
3 The film 's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of Juliette Binoche as Sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth .	
3 George Clooney , in his first directorial effort , presents this utterly ridiculous shaggy dog story as one of the most creative , energetic and original comedies to hit the screen in years .	
3 An engrossing Iranian film about two itinerant teachers and some lost and desolate people they encounter in a place where war has savaged the lives and liberties of the poor and the dispossessed .	
2 It must be in the genes .	
3 The story is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution .	
4 A powerful and telling story that examines forbidden love , racial tension , and other issues that are as valid today as they were in the 1950s .	
4 In a summer overrun with movies dominated by CGI aliens and super heroes , it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway .	
3 The unexpected thing is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful .	
2 It 's been 20 years since 48 Hrs .	
3 If there 's no art here , it 's still a good yarn -- which is nothing to sneeze at these days .	
2 A close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late .	
1 A feeble Tootsie knockoff .	
0 It 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah .	
2 Blade II has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation .	
2 ... has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon does n't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites .	
1 The story passes time until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .	
4 The film sparkles with the the wisdom and humor of its subjects .	
0 ... a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional .	
4 Best of all is Garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man .	
3 The mood , look and tone of the film fit the incredible storyline to a T.	
2 How about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ?	
0 One ca n't shake the feeling that Crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for Britney 's latest album .	
1 You 'll feel like you ate a Reeses without the peanut butter ... '	
1 The movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart .	
1 Ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film .	
4 It 's Quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer .	
1 Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?	
4 Barry convinces us he 's a dangerous , secretly unhinged guy who could easily have killed a president because it made him feel powerful .	
1 The problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay .	
0 Neither revelatory nor truly edgy -- merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .	
3 Children and adults enamored of all things Pokemon wo n't be disappointed .	
4 An extraordinary dramatic experience .	
1 It looks good , but it is essentially empty .	
3 Dogtown & Z-Boys evokes the blithe rebel fantasy with the kind of insouciance embedded in the sexy demise of James Dean .	
1 The story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive .	
0 I 've never seen -LRB- a remake -RRB- do anything as stomach-turning as the way Adam Sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates Frank Capra 's classic ...	
3 Nettelbeck ... has a pleasing way with a metaphor .	
4 Mike White 's deft combination of serious subject matter and dark , funny humor make `` The Good Girl '' a film worth watching .	
1 At every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability ... all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while Banderas looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad it	
1 Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .	
4 One regards Reign of Fire with awe .	
2 Parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there is n't enough clever innuendo to fil	
1 Just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills .	
2 It 's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction .	
3 For all its brooding quality , Ash Wednesday is suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable , with a sterling ensemble cast .	
1 Only masochistic moviegoers need apply .	
3 Caviezel embodies the transformation of his character completely .	
4 The best animated feature to hit theaters since Beauty and the Beast 11 years ago .	
3 Rubbo 's humorously tendentious intervention into the who-wrote-Shakespeare controversy .	
2 Real Women Have Curves does n't offer any easy answers .	
2 Who are ` they ' ?	
1 Helmer Hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome .	
3 Earnest , unsubtle and Hollywood-predictable , Green Dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of Vietnamese .	
4 Stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by Dustin Hoffman that is revelatory .	
1 Although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s\/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .	
4 Remarkable for its intelligence and intensity .	
3 UB equally spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of ` black culture ' and the dorkier aspects of ` white culture , ' even as it points out how inseparable the two are .	
1 Painfully padded .	
2 This movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it 's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it .	
1 Do n't say you were n't warned .	
2 Reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while Said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition .	
1 A portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers .	
1 Boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , Impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie .	
3 A bodice-ripper for intellectuals .	
0 An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' .	
2 It 's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true ` epic ' .	
0 The crap continues .	
1 Something has been lost in the translation ... another routine Hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise .	
1 When the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '	
0 The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .	
1 The Piano Teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control .	
1 It 's makes a better travelogue than movie .	
1 It 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness .	
3 This is one of the rarest kinds of films : a family-oriented non-Disney film that is actually funny without hitting below the belt .	
3 An energetic , violent movie with a momentum that never lets up .	
2 So verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-TV movie .	
3 It wo n't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , Finch 's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a Saturday matinee .	
1 `` White Oleander , '' the movie , is akin to a Reader 's Digest condensed version of the source material .	
1 This dreadfully earnest inversion of the Concubine love triangle eschews the previous film 's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .	
3 Anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but ca n't afford the $ 20 million ticket to ride a Russian rocket should catch this IMAX offering .	
1 Fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .	
0 Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` Clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .	
1 The acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the Wal-Mart checkout line .	
1 Ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action .	
3 One feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early Italian neorealism .	
4 A burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at .	
0 Stale and	
4 The Pianist is Polanski 's best film .	
3 It 's affecting , amusing , sad and reflective .	
4 An excellent sequel .	
4 Seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior , as Happiness was ... Hence , Storytelling is far more appealing .	
2 Weird , vulgar comedy that 's definitely an acquired taste .	
3 It certainly wo n't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time .	
4 The story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director Shekhar Kapur supplies with tremendous skill .	
4 What makes How I Killed My Father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is Fontaine 's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching .	
1 It made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy B-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's Reign of Fire .	
2 More of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller .	
3 The journey is worth your time , especially if you have Ellen Pompeo sitting next to you for the ride .	
4 Provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the Holocaust .	
3 Cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out , and at other times outside looking in .	
1 Pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two .	
3 It 's not like having a real film of Nijinsky , but at least it 's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered .	
1 A shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and Rocawear clothing .	
2 A different kind of love story - one that is dark , disturbing , painful to watch , yet compelling .	
1 Looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of Scarface or Carlito 's Way .	
2 Feeling like a dope has rarely been more fun than it is in Nine Queens .	
0 Of all the Halloween 's , this is the most visually unappealing .	
4 Directors Brett Morgen and Nanette Burstein have put together a bold biographical fantasia .	
1 You can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise .	
0 -LRB- MacDowell -RRB- ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is .	
2 The smash 'em - up , crash 'em - up , shoot 'em - up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense .	
0 Suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness .	
4 Offers a guilt-free trip into feel-good territory .	
1 Viewers of Barney 's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it .	
1 The film 's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed Crudup out of pre-9 \/ 11 New York and onto a cross-country road trip of the Homeric kind .	
2 A bonanza of wacky sight gags , outlandish color schemes , and corny visual puns that can be appreciated equally as an abstract Frank Tashlin comedy and as a playful recapitulation of the artist 's career .	
2 Ong chooses to present Ah Na 's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character 's blank-faced optimism .	
3 It 's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor .	
3 Oddly , the film is n't nearly as downbeat as it sounds , but strikes a tone that 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny .	
0 Any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors .	
3 The film 's gamble to occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter .	
1 The problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up Shum 's good intentions .	
4 The story 's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and Mr. Day-Lewis roars with leonine power .	
0 What ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between Americans and Brits .	
3 `` Extreme Ops '' exceeds expectations .	
3 A real audience-pleaser that will strike a chord with anyone who 's ever waited in a doctor 's office , emergency room , hospital bed or insurance company office .	
0 Devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special .	
0 ... an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler .	
1 Unfortunately , Carvey 's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with Harris Goldberg .	
1 ... begins with promise , but runs aground after being snared in its own tangled plot .	
3 Neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest Attal and Gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm .	
1 The trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of Showgirls .	
2 Buries an interesting storyline	
3 This one is a few bits funnier than Malle 's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like Slob City reductions of Damon Runyon crooks .	
0 ... an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .	
1 Its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock -LRB- since Sept. 11 -RRB- .	
1 Feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime ... and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work .	
2 Serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst .	
1 An inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director 's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .	
1 Rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue .	
1 It has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and R&B names and references .	
1 Leaks treacle from every pore .	
0 MIB II is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and\/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .	
1 essentially `` Fatal Attraction '' remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 .	
2 Meyjes focuses too much on Max when he should be filling the screen with this tortured , dull artist and monster-in-the - making .	
0 As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four .	
3 A harrowing account of a psychological breakdown .	
3 There 's absolutely no reason why Blue Crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is	
1 ... the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning .	
1 When the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence .	
3 A few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics are n't likely to enter the theater .	
0 Fred Schepisi 's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen .	
0 Yes , I have given this movie a rating of zero .	
3 A film of delicate interpersonal dances .	
2 In both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you .	
1 A listless and desultory affair .	
1 By the final whistle you 're convinced that this Mean Machine was a decent TV outing that just does n't have big screen magic .	
2 We could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product .	
3 Though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .	
1 Nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives .	
0 A less-than-thrilling thriller .	
1 Parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for Ram Dass 's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic .	
1 A prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .	
2 The plan to make Enough into ` an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller '	
2 Paxton 's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre .	
0 The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .	
2 There 's something about a marching band that gets me where I live .	
1 Wimps out by going for that PG-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .	
3 A four star performance from Kevin Kline who unfortunately works with a two star script .

4 Mr. Caine and Mr. Fraser are the whole show here , with their memorable and resourceful performances .	
1 The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .

3 Best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events .	
4 A wildly entertaining scan of Evans ' career .	
3 Upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that does n't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them .	
0 I 'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : This erotic cannibal movie is boring .	
4 With an admirably dark first script by Brent Hanley , Paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work .	
3 That the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that Chin 's film serves up with style and empathy .

1 The troubling thing about Clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense .	
0 It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .	
1 Seriously , rent the Disney version .	
1 It does n't flinch from its unsettling prognosis , namely , that the legacy of war is a kind of perpetual pain .	
2 There are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them .	
0 It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .
